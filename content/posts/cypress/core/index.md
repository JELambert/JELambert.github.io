The fundamental approach behind Cypress Synergy is to address each problem with an open mind set. Each case is different and rather than bringing in all the answers from experience, Cypress Synergy tries to incorporate new data with each iteration. In many ways the company itself functions as a learning algorithm would, getting better as it goes.

With that said, where Cypress Synergy sets itself apart is the broad range of tools it has to meet the customer's particular needs. We implement an inductive approach to uncover the right application of skills.

At the consultation Cypress Synergy will first identify the particular challenges a client faces. With this information it is possible to develop a framework for meeting those issues and tailor the specific methods accordingly.

Finally, a medium of communication that suits the customer is used to convey the work.
