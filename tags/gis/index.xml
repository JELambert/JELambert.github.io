This led me down a rabbit hole.
The conflict itself is almost entirely concentrated in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. Since the beginning of 2018 until November 9th, 2019, ACLED has recorded 1,267 fatalities as a result of the conflict. The data source has also recorded 55 unique actors involved.</description></item><item><title>Election Violence: Latin America</title><link>http://JELambert.github.io/posts/blog/election/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>http://JELambert.github.io/posts/blog/election/</guid><description>Electoral Contention and Violence (EVAC) A key pillar of democratic governance is elections. This represents the time when leadership can change hands. When it does so peacefully this is a sign of a strong and stable government.

A key part of both is the hydrological landscape that shapes the state. Following some inspiration from Näytä Data, I mapped out these systems using the National Hydrogrophy Dataset (NHD).
The Blue represents regions where rivers, lakes and streams are present. Rivers and streams are weighted by the Strahler number which measures the branch significance. To the west of the most important Mississippi river is the Atchafalaya, Red and Black rivers which run parallel.</description></item></channel></rss>
